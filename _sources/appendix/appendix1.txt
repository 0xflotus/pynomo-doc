    * - Characteristic
      - Computer
      - Nomogram
    * - Hardware Requirements
      - Computer, specialized calculator, or smartphone
      - Any straightedge, pencil
    * - Software Requirements
      - Application encapsulating the relevant relationships
      - Graphical representation of the relevant relationships
    * - Infrastructure Requirements
      - Computing resources, perhaps Internet access; if smartphone, appropriate app
      - Ambient light
    * - Energy Needs
      - Electrical outlet or batteries
      - Ambient light
    * - Learning Curve
      - Knowing what to punch in, plus learning curve for software, hardware, and infrastructure
      - Knowing how to connect two points, and how to interpolate a point on a scale
    * - Documentation
      - What documentation? Where?
      - Self-documenting
    * - Tool Distribution
      - Likely Internet access
      - Single sheet of paper
    * - Results Distribution
      - Need printer or Internet connection
      - Hand-carry or fax document
    * - Cost
      - Variable
      - Cost of duplicating and transmitting a single page
    * - Accuracy (decimal places)
      - As many as you want… if the software provides them
      - As many as you need… given the precision of the input
    * - Speed: As fast as…
      - …your hardware
      - …you can draw a straight line
    * - Sensitivity Analysis
      - Repeated data sets
      - Examination of graphic
    * - Implicit Solution
      - Usually difficult or impossible
      - Automatic
    * - Common Failure Mode
      - Punch in wrong numbers
      - Can’t find glasses
    * - Need to Calculate
      - None
      - None
    * - Third World Use
      - Problematic depending on computing accessibility
      - Works so long as pencil and paper are available
    * - GIGO Susceptibility
      - High; May be hard to detect
      - Garbage In is clearly documented
    * - Permanence
      - Need a printer
      - Creates a written record as part of usage pattern
    * - Trust Factor
      - Did the programmer get it right?
      - Did the nomographer get it right?
    * - Communication
      - Single number output
      - Graphical interactivity
    * - Pizzazz Factor
      - High: Very modern
      - Low: Old-fashioned slide-rule-like technology
