Installation
++++++++++++
pyNomo is a  `python2 <https://www.python.org>`_ library and thus requires working python installation on the computer.
pyNomo stands on the shoulders  of (read: requires) the python packages: `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_, `scipy <http://www.scipy.org>`_ and
`pyx <http://pyx.sourceforge.net>`_ that requires LaTeX-installation.

For editing pyNomo scripts any text browser works but integrated development environment (IDE) for python can speed up developments.
Good free IDE alternatives are for example `PyCharm community edition <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_ and `spyder <https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder>`_.
